  <strong>Vulnerability Reporting Process</strong>
</h2>

</div>

**Author:** JW Britz  
**Effective Date:** 2025‑08‑28  
**Scope:** All code, documentation, configurations, workflows, and artifacts stored in or linked from this repository.

---

## 1. Mandate & Purpose
This repository operates under **zero‑tolerance for negligence**.  
Security is not a feature — it is **doctrine**. All contributors, tools, and processes exist under the expectation of **continuous integrity, vigilance, and discipline**.

This policy defines how to protect the **integrity, confidentiality, and availability** of:
- Source code, scripts, and Infrastructure‑as‑Code (IaC)
- Documentation and examples that could enable insecure practices
- Configuration files, automation/orchestration code
- Generated artifacts (e.g., PDFs, configs) that may reveal sensitive information
- Evidence artefacts (logs, screenshots, forensic captures)

---

## 2. If You Find a Vulnerability

If you discover a **potential** security issue:

**Do NOT**:
- Create a public GitHub issue
- Discuss or share it in public forums or social media

**Do**:
- Contact privately using:

| Method     | Address / Link                                             | Notes                               |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Email**  | [contact@yourdomain.com](mailto:contact@yourdomain.com)    | Include `[SECURITY]` in subject     |
| **PGP Key**| [Link to PGP key]                                           | Encrypt sensitive communications   |

When reporting, include:
- Clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact or exploit path

**Acknowledgement** is issued within **24 hours**; assessment begins immediately.

---

## 3. Handling & Remediation
- All security reports are logged under `/governance/audit/logs/`
- Triage within **48 hours** of receipt
- Fixes merged only after:
  - **CODEOWNERS** sign‑off
  - Passing all CI/CD integrity checks
  - Evidence of remediation attached to the case file

---

## 4. Secure Development Standards
- **No secrets** committed — `.gitignore` enforces this
- All changes pass:
  - Static code analysis
  - Dependency vulnerability scanning
  - Configuration validation
- Evidence artefacts are **sanitized** prior to commit

---

## 5. Enforcement
Violations of this policy are:
- Logged permanently in governance records
- Grounds for immediate **revocation of contributor privileges**
- Subject to internal review and, if necessary, escalation to external authorities

---

## 6. Standing Order
> *Security is not what you deploy — it’s what you enforce, every single time.*
