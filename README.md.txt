# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Portfolio — Executive‑Grade & Reproducible

Welcome to my **cybersecurity portfolio** — a **living, auditable record** of hands‑on labs, incident response workflows, and strategic documentation.  
This repository is engineered for **technical depth** *and* **executive clarity**, demonstrating not only the “how” but also the “why” behind every action.

## 📌 Mission & Value Proposition

| Goal | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Technical Mastery** | Showcasing end‑to‑end execution in ethical hacking, incident response, and systems hardening, with **verified evidence** and reproducible setups. |
| **Leadership & Governance** | Clear governance layer with roadmaps, CEO feedback integration, and standards for operational hygiene. |
| **Evidence Hygiene via CI/CD** | Automated workflows for integrity checks, PDF exports, link validation, and spellchecking — ensuring trust in every artifact. |
| **Recruiter/CEO‑Friendly** | Executive summaries accompany all technical reports for non‑technical decision‑makers. |
