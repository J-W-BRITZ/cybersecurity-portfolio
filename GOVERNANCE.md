## 1. Purpose & Authority
This governance framework defines the **law of the land** for this repository.  
It is the **single source of truth** for conduct, structure, and operational discipline — binding on all contributors, maintainers, and external collaborators.

By engaging with this repository, you are operating under **mandate** to protect its integrity, reputation, and strategic objectives.

---

## 2. Governance Principles
Our governance rests on **four immutable pillars**:

1. **Integrity of Artifacts** – Every commit is intentional, reviewable, and traceable.
2. **Operational Hygiene** – No half‑measures; every process is repeatable, documented, and executed cleanly.
3. **Controlled Change** – No bypassing formal review gates; governance rules are the guardrails of progress.
4. **Executive Clarity** – All outputs must stand the scrutiny of senior leadership without additional explanation.

## 3. Roles & Responsibilities
| Role                | Responsibility                                                                 |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Owner**           | Final authority, strategic direction, policy updates.                          |
| **Maintainer**      | Enforces governance, reviews merges, upholds security and CI/CD integrity.     |
| **Contributor**     | Adheres to all templates, coding standards, and evidence hygiene rules.        |
| **Auditor**         | Reviews compliance, verifies artifact traceability, signs off on governance logs.|

---

## 4. Change Control
- All modifications pass through **pull request review** with **CODEOWNERS approval**.
- Critical governance or security changes require **two‑maintainer concurrence**.
- Merges are blocked until **evidence hygiene checks** and **workflow runs** pass 100%.

---

## 5. Compliance & Audit
- **Quarterly** reviews are mandatory and logged under `/governance/audit/logs/`.
- Non‑compliant artifacts are **quarantined** until remediation is complete.
- Audit results are archived for **minimum 24 months** to preserve historical traceability.

---

## 6. Enforcement
Governance violations are escalated directly to the **Owner**.  
Persistent or deliberate non‑compliance will result in **revocation of contributor rights** and formal record in governance logs.

---

## 7. Standing Orders
> *Precision is discipline. Discipline is trust. Trust is currency.*

By contributing to this portfolio, you agree to operate under these governance rules and accept that **branding, process, and policy** are inseparable elements of professional cybersecurity practice.
