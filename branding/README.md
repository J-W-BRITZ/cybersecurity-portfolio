# Branding Guidelines — Executive Cybersecurity Portfolio

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines **the official usage standards** for the JW Britz Executive Cybersecurity Portfolio crest.  
It is the **only authorised source** for visual identity rules — every appearance of the crest must comply with this guide to maintain **integrity, authority, and consistency** across all materials.

---

## 2. The Crest

- **Asset file:** `executive-badge.svg.png`
- **Location:** `./branding/`
- **Status:** *Master asset — single source of truth*
- **Format:** PNG with embedded SVG layer for clarity at all scales
- **Role:** Visual seal of trust, authority, and operational discipline

---

## 3. Usage Doctrine

- **Always place with precision** — alignment and size match placement map in `/badge-placement.md`.
- **No distortion** — never stretch, crop, or alter proportions.
- **Maintain clarity** — minimum width: 110px; maximum width: 420px.
- **Keep contrast high** — place on solid backgrounds only.
- **One crest per document** — excess usage dilutes authority.
- **No unauthorised derivatives** — colours, shapes, and symbols remain unchanged.

## 4. Placement Protocols

| Document | Alignment | Width (px) | Context |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `/README.md` | Center | 420 | Portfolio entry point — hero display |
| `/GOVERNANCE.md` | Left | 110 | Sealed governance charter |
| `/SECURITY.md` | Center | 160 | Security policy banner |
| `/CONTRIBUTING.md` | Right | 140 | Operational charter |
| `/CHANGELOG.md` | Right | 120 | Discreet stamp |
| Section READMEs | Center/Left/Right per `/badge-placement.md` | 120–160 | Section headers |

---

## 5. Storage & Integrity

- The master crest resides **only** in `/branding/`.
- No copies stored in other directories.
- File name must remain unchanged unless versioning (e.g., `executive-badge.v2.svg.png`).
- Changes require update to:
  - `/badge-placement.md`
  - `/CHANGELOG.md`
- All modifications logged under `/governance/audit/logs/`

---

## 6. Display Standards

- **Digital:** Optimised for GitHub rendering, PDF export, and HTML previews.
- **Print:** Vector fidelity preserved via embedded SVG — ready for high‑DPI output.
- **Accessibility:** Alt text always includes name and context (e.g., “JW Britz — Governance Charter”).

---

## 7. Enforcement

- **Violations** recorded in governance logs.
- **Unapproved usage** will be removed.
- Crest integrity is treated as **brand security** — enforce without exception.

> **The crest is more than an image — it is a command signature. Treat it with the precision, respect, and control it demands.**
