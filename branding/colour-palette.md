# Color Palette — JW Britz Executive Cybersecurity Portfolio

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **official color doctrine** of the JW Britz Executive Cybersecurity Portfolio, extracted directly from the master crest.  
Each tone is a **visual rank** — projecting authority, trust, and operational discipline.  
Unapproved changes are breaches of brand integrity.

## 3. Application Protocols

- **Hierarchy of Power** — Ravenfield Black dominates. All other tones support and never overpower.
- **Crest Integrity** — Heraldic Gold must match exactly for consistency with the badge.
- **No Fades** — Colors are deployed as flat fills; gradients weaken authority.
- **High Contrast** — Maintain at least a 7:1 ratio for text over backgrounds.
- **Discipline in Red** — Strategic Crimson is mission-critical only; overuse dilutes impact.
